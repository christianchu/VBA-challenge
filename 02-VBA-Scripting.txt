I had lots of challenges with this assignment. 
Primarily isses with identifying the max and min values within the for loop conditional if statement. 
Spent most of my time trying to use worksheetfunction.vlookup and worksheetfunction.match. Had more success with vlookup but could only use a range. 
Range would not accept the i variable which I could understand would break the for loop.

Overall it was challenging and great to learn from. Had fun looking at documentation in stack overflow where people would ask similar questions.
